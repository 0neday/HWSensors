Open source SMC device driver/emulator (FakeSMC) by netkas (http://netkas.org/) with hardware monitoring plugins ported from OpenHardwareMonitor for Windows and hwmon sensors drivers from Linux.

IMPORTANT: Do not install DRIVERS on real mac! This even may work but you are doing it at your own risk. On the other side HWMonitor.app is fully compatible with Macs so you can still use it to monitor hardware sensors provided by SMC.
