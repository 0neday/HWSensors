HWSensors is a software bundle includes drivers and applications allow you to access information from various sensors available on your MAC.

FakeSMC is an open source SMC device driver/emulator developed by netkas (http://netkas.org/).

NOTE: FakeSMC & Plugins starting from v915 provide additional sensors information to HWMonitor then running on Macs. By installing FakeSMC on real Mac you should consider you know what you are doing and how to recover your system if something will goes wrong.
